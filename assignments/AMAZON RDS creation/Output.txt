I have created amazon RDS instance using "Standard Create", with port 3306
I have created an EC2 instance with t3.micro
The port 3306 was opened on the security group on the RDS instance. 
I have used different security groups fro EC2 and the db instances. 
3306 was needed to open only on db instance. on EC2 instance, I have not opened 3306 port. 
I was able to connect to Ec2 instance and then from that instance connected to db using mysql client.
Created table and added data in the db. 
Tried to change VPC on the RDS. There is no option to change VPC. 
Tried to change subnet group. It gave me error. It says db instance and db subnet group canot be in the same vpc.
